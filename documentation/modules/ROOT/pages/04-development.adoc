[#devspaces]
== OpenShift Dev Spaces

While there are many ways to craft a Golden Path for your development staff, the option to include OpenShift Dev Spaces provides a quick path to success with zero laptop installation effort.

In this chapter you will use Dev Spaces to introduce a new API endpoint to your Gateway component.  The goal will be to add a custom datapoint to the "Red Hat Summit POI" dataset, which is stored in-memory within the Gateway component.

[#gateway_update]
== Use Dev Spaces to update the Gateway
Enter your <NAMESPACE> into the search input of the Software Catalog to find your Gateway component entity

From the Gateway Component Overview page, click on "OpenShift Dev Spaces (VS Code)"

Click on "Log in with OpenShift"

image::login_4.png[]

Select the "GitHub" login option

Grant Dev Spaces access to your OpenShift account

Make sure to click on *`Grant`* next to the **Summit23DevRHEL** GitHub Org before approving Dev Spaces access

Wait for your workspace to load.  This may take several minutes...

After Dev Spaces has loaded your workspace, select "Yes, I trust the authors" to open the code editor

Open `/src/main/java/com/rhdevelopers/summit/workshop/SummitBackendResource.java`

Uncomment the following code block near the bottom of the file:

[.console-input]
[source,java,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
    @POST
    @Path("poi/add/point")
    public Response loadCustomPoi(PoiRecord record) {
        SUMMIT_POI_RECORDS.add(record);
        return Response.created(
            UriBuilder.fromPath("fake/poi/find/"+(SUMMIT_POI_RECORDS.size()-1)).build()
        ).entity("inserted custom data point").build();
    }

[#validate_changes]
== Validate your Changes

Connect to a Pod in the Gateway Deployment to test the new API endpoint

First, use the Topology view to examine the Gateway component

image::top_3.png[]

Click on the running pod

image::top_3_gateway.png[]

If needed, delete the Running pod in order to trigger a redeploy

image::gateway_pod_delete.png[]

Return to the Topology view to open a connection to the new Gateway pod

image::top_3.png[]
image::top_3_gateway.png[]

Open a terminal connection on the new pod

image::gateway_pod_terminal.png[]

Paste the following curl command into the terminal to test the new API endpoint:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/fake/poi/add/point/' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
"name":"Milano, Italy",
"description":"example city",
"coordinates":[45.464203,9.189982]
}'
----

A successful `POST` to your new API endpoint will return `inserted custom data point`. Reload the map to look for your new Point.

Optionally reconnect the backend component with the gateway component to make the National Parks dataset visible again:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
curl poi-gateway-app:8080/backend/register/poi-backend?endpoint=http://poi-backend-app:8080
