The last chapter in the Backstage Golden Path workshop uses OpenShift Dev Spaces to edit source code and add a feature to your application. Committing your changes to the Backstage-provisioned repo will in turn trigger the platform to automatically rebuild your enhanced component. You will then verify your change by connecting to a Pod in the Gateway Deployment and testing the new API endpoint.

[#gateway_feature]
== Code a new feature

In this chapter you will add a custom location to the "Red Hat Summit POI" dataset maintained in memory in the Gateway component. To make it possible to add arbitrary locations, you need to add a new `loadCustomPoi` endpoint to the API provided by the Gateway. An HTTP `POST` to `loadCustomPoi` specifies coordinates and metadata to add a location to the map displayed by your application.

[#dev_spaces]
=== OpenShift Dev Spaces

https://developers.redhat.com/products/openshift-dev-spaces/overview[OpenShift Dev Spaces] is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) hosted on the lab's OpenShift cluster and ready to run in your web browser. It's based on the open source VSCode, so its features, interface, and large plugin ecosystem are already familiar to many developers. You'll use Dev Spaces to edit code and push your changes to your application's central repository.

[#extend_gateway]
=== Extend the Gateway API

Enter your NAMESPACE into the search input of the Software Catalog to find your Gateway entity. Or, you can select your user name, which also matches your Project/NAMESPACE name, from the _Owner_ pulldown menu on the left.

From the Gateway Component Overview page, click on "OpenShift Dev Spaces (VS Code)" to launch a new browser tab running the Dev Spaces IDE.

Click on _Log in with OpenShift_

image::login_4.png[]

Select the _GitHub_ login option

image::login_5.png[]

Click on _Allow selected permissions_ to grant Dev Spaces your access to OpenShift.

image::auth_6.png[]

IMPORTANT: Make sure to click on *`Grant`* next to the **Summit23JanusN** GitHub Org before approving Dev Spaces access (where _N_ matches your cluster's GitHub Org ID number).

Wait for your Dev Spaces workspace to load. This can take a minute. You will see a loading screen while the workspace is being provisioned, where Dev Spaces is creating a workspace based on a default https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_openshift_dev_spaces/3.1/html/user_guide/introduction-to-devfile[devfile], which can be customized to include your own tools and configuration.

After Dev Spaces has loaded your workspace, select _Yes, I trust the authors_ to open the code editor on your clone of your code repo for the Gateway component.

image::trust_the_authors.png[]

Select the file `/src/main/java/com/rhdevelopers/summit/workshop/SummitBackendResource.java` in the left-hand file tree. Delete the comment markers (`/&ast;` and `&ast;/`) on line 73 and line 82 to enable the block of code they surround:

=== Commit your change and sync

Click on the Source Control tab in the left sidebar, then select the plus icon to add your change to the changeset.

image::add_changes.png[]

Enter your commit message in the top input box. Click "Commit" when done.

image::commit.png[]

Click on "Sync Changes" to publish your changes to GitHub

image::sync.png[]

Click "OK" to confirm and push

image::push.png[]

Check the resulting pipelines for activity by selecting *Pipelines* from the side menu in the OpenShift web console.  If the gateway pipeline is not running, click on the activity icon to the right, and select "Start last run" to trigger a new pipeline build:

image::pipelines_3_restart.png[]

Wait until the pipeline run has reached completion. This will indicate that a new image has been built and is now available for deployment

[#validate_changes]
=== Use your new feature

Connect to a Pod in the Gateway Deployment to test the new API endpoint.

First, use the Topology view to examine the Gateway component

image::top_3.png[]

Click on the running pod

image::top_3_gateway_2.png[]

Open a terminal connection on the new pod

image::gateway_pod_terminal.png[]

Paste the following curl command into the terminal to test the new API endpoint:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
curl --location 'http://localhost:8080/fake/poi/add/point/' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
"name":"Milano, Italy",
"description":"example city",
"coordinates":[45.464203,9.189982]
}'
----

A successful `POST` to your new API endpoint will return: `inserted custom data point`

Reload the map and hide the National Parks map layer to look for your new Point.

If you see more than two points in the "Red Hat Summit POI" dataset, then you have successfully completed our Golden Path onboarding experience by pushing, building, deploying, and verifying your change.

[#next_steps]
== Paving your own Golden Path

You have made it to the end of the National Parks Map application Golden Path. _Congratulations!_

Now it's your turn to begin crafting your own Golden Paths using Backstage Software Templates and related platform services such as ArgoCD, Tekton, Dev Spaces, and OpenShift.
