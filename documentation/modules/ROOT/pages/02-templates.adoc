[#frontend]
== Launch the Frontend template
Click on `Create...` in the sidebar menu. *CHOOSE* the _Angular Single Page Application (SPA) for Points of Interest (POI) Map_ template.

Keep default values in every field except the _Repository Name_ in the first section, the _Namespace_ and _Owner_ fields in the second section, and the _Image Name_ field in the third section of the template create form. You will adapt each of those fields for your own user and Project/namespace. Recall from chapter 1 that some Backstage forms refer to a Namespace that is equivalent to your OpenShift Project.

Type or paste your Project/namespace name to replace the NAMESPACE placeholder in the _Repository Name_ field. The result should be something like `projectname-frontend`. Click NEXT STEP to continue.

In the second section of the template create form, type or paste your Project/namespace name to replace the NAMESPACE placeholder in the _Namespace_ field. The result should be something like `projectname`.

Fill in the _Owner_ field by either *A)* Clicking the Owner field and selecting the `user:NAMESPACE` matching your Project name from the pull-down menu, *or* *B)* if your Project name does not appear in the Owners pull-down menu, typing the literal string `user`, followed by a colon `:`, followed by your Project name. The resulting string should be something like `user:projectname`.

Click NEXT STEP to proceed to the third section of the template create form.

Type or paste your Project name to replace the NAMESPACE placeholder in the _Image Name_ field of the create form's third section. The result should be something like `projectname/poi-map-app`. Click NEXT STEP to review the configuration you've set in the frontend template.

Review your configuration, making sure that your own Project name is as expected in the fields you adjusted: _Repo Name_, _Namespace_, _Owner_, and _Image Name_. Click `CREATE` to deploy your frontend component.

Review the output from deploying the template.  Click on the _Source Code Repository_ link to view the scaffolded frontend source code repository.

[#github]
== View the source

Explore the repository Backstage created for you with the frontend component source code. Each scaffolded repo is part of the GitHub Org used in this workshop. Each one is prefixed with your Project/namespace name, giving your frontend component's source code repository a qualified name like github.com/Summit23JanusN/_NAMESPACE_-frontend.
