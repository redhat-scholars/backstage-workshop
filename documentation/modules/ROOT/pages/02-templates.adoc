Click on `Create...` in the sidebar menu. *CHOOSE* the _Angular Single Page Application (SPA) for Points of Interest (POI) Map_ template.

Keep default values in every field except the _Repository Name_ in the first section, the _Namespace_ and _Owner_ fields in the second section, and the _Image Name_ field in the third section of the template create form. You will adapt each of those fields for your own user and Project/namespace. Recall from chapter 1 that some Backstage forms refer to a Namespace that is equivalent to your OpenShift Project.

Type or paste your Project/namespace name to replace the NAMESPACE placeholder in the _Repository Name_ field. The result should be something like `projectname-frontend`. Click NEXT STEP to continue.

In the second section of the template create form, type or paste your Project/namespace name to replace the NAMESPACE placeholder in the _Namespace_ field. The result should be something like `projectname`.

Fill in the _Owner_ field by either *A)* Clicking the Owner field and selecting the `user:NAMESPACE` matching your Project name from the pull-down menu, *or* *B)* if your Project name does not appear in the Owners pull-down menu, typing the literal string `user`, followed by a colon `:`, followed by your Project name. The resulting string should be something like `user:projectname`.

Click NEXT STEP to proceed to the third section of the template create form.

Type or paste your Project name to replace the NAMESPACE placeholder in the _Image Name_ field of the create form's third section. The result should be something like `projectname/poi-map-app`. Click NEXT STEP to review the configuration you've set in the frontend template.
