[#project_access]
=== OpenShift Project

Your user will have an OpenShift _Project_ for your exclusive use. Projects are a superset of the base Kubernetes _namespace_, and isolate resource names and access rights from other Projects on the cluster. Your OpenShift user and Project names both match the GitHub ID you used to log in.

Remember your Project name. You'll specify it in Template forms as your "Namespace" value as you deploy components.

Next, you'll connect to Backstage and discover the starting point for developing your application. Once that's done, Backstage _Templates_ will help you generate software components as you build a three-tier GeoSpatial mapping demo application.

[#backstage_access]
