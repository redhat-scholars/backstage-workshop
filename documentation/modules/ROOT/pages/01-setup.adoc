== Prerequisites
You will need a GitHub account in order to follow along with this workshop.  Account activation is free and requires fewer than five minutes to complete.  If you do not have a github account, or are not prepared to authenticate using your existing account, please sign up for a new account now at github.com

Enter your github username in the onboarding doc then alert a lab assistant, and we will add you to the GitHub Org.  You will need to receive **and accept** an invite from our team before continuing on to the next step!

[#cluster_access]
== Cluster Access

Check the onboarding doc for the latest cluster access urls and credentials ✅

Open the provided web console url in your browser to connect to the openshift web console. Choose the "Login with Github" option to proceed.

[#project_access]
=== Project Access

This OpenShift cluster has been configured to automatically establish an initial project namespace for your work. 

After logging in with Github, you should see a list of Projects with one result.  The project name should match your github id.

Remember this project name!  You will need to enter it into several template inputs as your "Namespace" value in the next chapter.

Next, you will begin to populate this project namespace with new software components, generated via templates, as you build a three-tier GeoSpatial mapping demo application. 

But first, the final step in this section involves connecting to our instance of Backstage.

[#backstage_access]
== Logging in to Backstage

Click on the app launcher link in the header menu and select "Backstage" to connect to your backstage instance.

You will be prompted to authenticate.  Again, use the GitHub signin option.

After authenticating via GitHub, Backstage will greet you with a cheerful "Welcome back!"

Now that we have established a project namespace on the cluster and a successful connection to backstage, you can start to create your workloads using Templates to populate the Service Catalog.
