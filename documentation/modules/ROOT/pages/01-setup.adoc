[#project_access]
=== OpenShift Project

Your user will have an OpenShift _Project_ for your exclusive use. Projects are a superset of the base Kubernetes _namespace_, and isolate resource names and access rights from other Projects on the cluster. Your OpenShift user and Project names both match the GitHub ID you used to log in.

TIP: The project will be created in the background as you log in. If you do not find a project, try reloading your browser to refresh the listing.

IMPORTANT: Remember your Project name! You will need enter it into the Template forms as your *<Namespace>* value as you deploy components in the next two chapters.
