Complete these four commands to load the backend dataset and to register the backend with the gateway component:

1. Check the backend dataservice for records. The result should be an empty set:
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
curl localhost:8080/ws/data/all
----

2. Populate the backend with the National Parks dataset:
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
curl localhost:8080/ws/data/load
----

3. List registered gateway backends. The only result should be the gateway's built-in "Red Hat Summit POI" dataset:
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
curl poi-gateway-app:8080/backend/list
----

4. Register the new backend component with the gateway component:
+
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
curl poi-gateway-app:8080/backend/register/poi-backend?endpoint=http://poi-backend-app:8080
----

Check the map for results!
